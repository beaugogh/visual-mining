# FreeBu


[**FreeBu**](http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~bo.gao/freebu/) is an interactive visualization tool for users to explore the patterns in any network and hierarchical datasets.

*Background*: FreeBu was originally developed under the [SPION](http://www.spion.me/) project. It was designed to visualize Facebook users' ego-networks and help users create friend groupings for the purpose of online contact management, hence the name FreeBu -- Facebook Tree Bubbles. However, due to Facebook graph API updates, we eventually decided to make FreeBu a generic visualization tool that visualizes any network and hierarchical data with [specified formats](https://github.com/beaugogh/FreeBu/blob/master/data-spec.md).
